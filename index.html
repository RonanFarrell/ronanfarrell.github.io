            <p> well, what is it today? more spelunking? i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. ,</p>

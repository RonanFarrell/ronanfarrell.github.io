                <p>Hi, I'm <span class=highlight>Ronan Farrell</span> and I am a <span class=highlight>video game developer</span>.</p>
                
                <p class=lower>I graduated from <span class=highlight>IT Carlow games development</span> in 2013. Primarily I develop games for <span class=highlight>HTML5</span> canvas with <span class=highlight>JavaScript</span>. I have a strong grounding in <span class=highlight>C++</span> and have developed games using <span class=highlight>Ogre3D</span> and <span class=highlight>Havok Physics</span>. When I'm not making games I like to mess around with some <span class=highlight>web development</span>.</p>

                <p class=lower>Get in touch on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/ronan_f_">@ronan_f_</a> or by email <a href="mailto:rrrfarrell@gmail.com">rrrfarrell@gmail.com</a></p>

            <p>ImploExplo is a coop platformer developed for browsers using <span class='highlight'>HTML5 &amp; JavaScript</span>. The game revolves around two characters, Implo and Explo, and their unique abilities. Implo can implode pulling objects, including Explo, towards it. Explo does the opposite, it can explode, pushing objects away from it.</p>

            <p>PortaLESS is a 3D puzzle games made with Ogre3D and Havok Physics. The game involves using a gravity gun to interact with the environment to solve various physics puzzles.</p>
            <h2>Particles<span>2013</span></h2>
            <img src="http://placekitten.com/800/400">
            <p>Particles was developed as part of a technical interview. It turned out pretty well so I decided to put it up here. It is written in JavaScript and uses the HTML5 canvas for rendering. It is a bit rough around the edges, it was made in about three hours, most of that involved developing the UI.</p>
            <h2>Turbo Trolley Racers<span>2012</span></h2>

            <p>Turbo Trolley Racers was developed with Keith Cully during third year of college. Written in C++ and uses Ogre3D and PhysX. We displayed the game at the Festival International des Jeux, Cannes in February 2012.</p>
